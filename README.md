# Roblox-RoShade
improve Roblox's visuals by applying shaders to the game using a post-processing injector called 'Reshade'. Roshade is an installation package that makes it easy to correctly install Reshade presets and shaders to the Roblox directory. With Roshade, you can quickly and easily customize your Roblox experience with advanced visual effects.


# Does RoShade have a virus?
Windows may show a pop up, but this is standard for 'unknown' applications. You can skip these messages by pressing 'more info' and 'run anyway'. RoShade is a false positive due to the fact of it modifying Roblox files to install the shaders.


# Getting Started
To get started with Roshade, you'll first need to download the latest release from the releases page. Once you've downloaded the installer, simply run it and follow the prompts to install Roshade. Once installation is complete, you'll be able to launch Roblox and start customizing your visual experience with the included Reshade presets and shaders.

If you have any questions or issues with Roshade, please feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.

# Is RoShade free?
Yes, you can get RoShade for free by going into the releases tab and downloading the most recent release of RoShade. RoShade will always stay free.


# Can I get banned for using RoShade?
RoShade is completely client-side and non-malicious. In years of production, there have been no reported cases of anyone getting banned for using Roshade. With that in mind, use it at your own risk.


# Do I need an RTX graphics card?
No. It is recommended to use an RTX graphics card for RoShade, but it is not a requirement. RoShade is known to run fine on non-RTX graphics cards as well, but with decreased performance.
